# Hammer

## What is the CLI?

The Hammer CLI provides users with a command-line interface for interacting
with Katello. It's our goal to make all functionality that's accessible through
Katello's Web UI also available through Hammer so that users may use Hammer for
their entire Katello workflow.

## How do I use Hammer?

To get started with hammer, view the help:

    hammer -u <user> -p <password> --help

## How do I contribute to Hammer?

See the [Katello Hammer CLI project](https://github.com/Katello/hammer-cli-katello)
if you want to get setup for contributing to the hammer code.
