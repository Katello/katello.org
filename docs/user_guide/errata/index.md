# Errata

Errata are incremental updates between major releases.  An Erratum is metadata about a group of packages that explains the importance of the package updates.
Errata may be released individually on an as-needed basis or aggregated as a minor release.  There are three main types of errata:

- Enhancement:  the new packages contain one or more added features
- Bugfix: the new packages contain one or more bug fixes
- Security:  the new packages fix one or more security vulnerabilities
