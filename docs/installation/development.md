# Development Installation

Katello provides the `katello-deploy` git repository which is designed to streamline setup by setting up all the proper repositories.
Katello deploy provides the ability to deploy a virtual machine instance via Vagrant or direct deployment on an already provisioned machine.

For details on how to install using katello-deploy, please see the [README](https://github.com/Katello/katello-deploy/blob/master/README.md).
